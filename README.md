# Palindrome_Checker
As a bonus to this script, I wrote my first ever python unittest and I'm so proud of it!


This program takes any given string you put want and checks if it's a palindrome or not. For example, "racecar" is a palindrome.

A palindrome is a word that is spelled the same forwards and backwards.
